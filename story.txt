I was at the local ratskeller with my hund and we were having a good time when suddenly
Someone ran and threw an apfelkuchen right at my face
As the person ran away I noticed it was a little girl wearing a dirndel
I went outside to see that she thrown a huge gebaeck at my convertible BMW as well
There was some bratwurst and brot on the car too
